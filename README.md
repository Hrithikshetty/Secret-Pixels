# Secret Pixels - Text Encryption inÂ Visuals & AI services

Our application improves digital security and communication privacy by utilizing AI services and steganography. The tool secretly and securely embeds sensitive data into digital photographs by using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique to encrypt and decode text within images. For people and organizations who need to send sensitive information without arousing suspicion, this capability is perfect.

To better shield users from online dangers, the app also offers strong AI services:

### Image Toxicity Analysis: 
This function promotes a safer online environment by using AI to evaluate picture content for offensive or hazardous content.

### Phishing URL Detection: 
To protect users from harmful assaults, the program analyzes URLs that are inserted into emails or pictures in order to identify any phishing efforts.

### AI Chatbot for Scam Detection: 
With the ability to assess the probability of a message being a scam, our chatbot is sophisticated enough to identify and warn consumers about fraudulent schemes by assigning a scam level score.

## Target Audience
### Private Individuals: 
People who prioritize privacy and need secure methods to communicate sensitive information.
### Businesses and Corporations: 
Companies that handle confidential data and require robust methods to protect against data breaches and cyber threats.
### Security Professionals:
Experts in cybersecurity who need advanced tools to detect and prevent phishing and scams.
### Content Moderators:
Organizations and platforms aiming to ensure that the visual content shared on their platforms is free from toxic or inappropriate material.
